#### Migrations considerations

    - Who owns the data
    - Boundary context
    - How it will scale

- What does this application do and how are its components organized?
- How can you break your data needs up based on the command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern?
- How does the application scale and what components drive the capacity you need?
- Do you have schedule-based tasks?
- Do you have workers listening to a queue?
- Where can you refactor or enhance functionality without impacting the current implementation?
