You're working on an existing application that writes its state data to an Amazon DynamoDB Table using the PutItem API. You want to build an asynchronous, event-driven observer mechanism that watches for item-level changes happening in this existing DynamoDB Table and invoke a Lambda function to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic of the change. What is the lowest cost solution while still using DynamoDB?

Use Amazon Kinesis Firehose: as an item is written to the Amazon DynamoDB Table, Amazon Kinesis Firehose writes the data to Amazon S3 bucket. The Amazon S3 bucket is configured with an onCreate event to invoke a Lambda function that publishes a message to an Amazon SNS Topic.
Creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a regular schedule which invokes a Lambda function. This Lambda function performs a scan operation of the Amazon DynamoDB Table, and performs a diff against its last invocation. If there's a difference, a message is published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic.
Update the existing application's implementation to write its state data to Amazon DynamoDB Table, then conditionally wait for a '200 OK' response from the PutItem API before invoking the Lambda function to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service SNS Topic.
Use Amazon DynamoDB Streams: as an item is written to the Amazon DynamoDB Table, a new stream record is written to reflect the item-level change that has happened to the table. This new stream record invokes a Lambda function, reading the data from the stream record, and publishes a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic.
Comments: Correct, DynamoDB Streams is ideal for implementing an asynchronous, event-driven observer mechanism. This arrangement is particular useful for Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns.

An architect is designing a real-time chat module for a new online game platform and wants to use the WebSocket API capabilities within Amazon API Gateway. An important requirement for this chat system is the ability to track the current number of active users on the platform.

Which of the options below could help implement this functionality?

Use the $default route to trigger a Lambda function that increments an active user count in DynamoDB.
Use the predefined $active route when a connection is activated to trigger a Lambda function that updates an active users counter stored in a DynamoDB table.
Use the `active-connections` command on the @connections API to periodically retrieve the total number of active connections and store this as a count in a DynamoDB table.
Use the $connect and $disconnect predefined routes to trigger a Lambda Function which increments and decrements an active user counter in DynamoDB respectively.
Comments: This is the correct answer. The $connect and $disconnected routes are predefined routes that are called when a client connects to the API and when the client or the server disconnects respectively.

A retail company has asked you to improve their backend infrastructure. They are receiving customer complaints about their web store. On peak load hours, customers are seeing error messages from the backend when they submit purchase orders. The orders are lost unless the customers repeat the order process.

How can you change the infrastructure to improve the customer experience and avoid losing orders?

Use API Gateway throttling to avoid overwhelming the backend with too many requests avoiding the generation of errors.
Create asynchronous communication between the Amazon API Gateway and Amazon Lambda using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue to store incoming orders until they are processed by Lambda.
Comments: Decoupling API Gateway from Lambda, the backend errors are not shown to the end user. SQS allows for asynchronous communication with error handling through a Dead Letter Queue and durable storage
Create synchronous communication between the Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda and have Amazon API Gateway send failed requests to an Amazon Dead Letter Queue
Create asynchronous communication between the API Gateway and Lambda using an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to store the orders until they are processed by Lambda.

A Solutions Architect is working with a company to migrate an existing application to AWS Lambda. A key requirement for the application is high throughput and low latency. The company is concerned about the potential impact of Lambda cold starts.

Which of the following Lambda design best practices can help to reduce cold start durations? (Select TWO)

Include only the dependencies and modules needed by the function.
Comments: Minimizing the number of deployment packages and the overall deployment size will reduce the startup time for a Lambda function.
Avoid using recursive code in the Lambda functions.
Use environment variables for operational parameters.
Separate business logic from Lambda-specific handler code.
Write modular functions that have a singular purpose.
Comments: Writing modular functions that have a single purpose minimizes the amount of code and dependencies that need to be downloaded and unpackaged before the function is invoked. This will help to reduce cold start times.

Your team is getting ready to build a new serverless application using AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon API Gateway. You have been tasked with selecting the tool the team will use to build the serverless application. The developers need to be able to locally invoke and test functions and deploy resources in production and non-production environments in a consistent manner.

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)
Comments: This is incorrect. CDK is used to model and provision resources but CDK alone does not provide local invocation and testing capabilities.

Your company has a serverless application with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda having both read, as well as, write APIs. The developers make frequent changes to the Lambda code and run load tests on the application after every change. The regular load testing has resulted in a spike in the cost.

What are the best practices and cost savings options available on their Lambda compute usage? (Select TWO)

Changing Lambda code does not necessarily require load testing. Unit and integration tests are sufficient.
Comments: Load test is a type of performance test that checks how systems function under a heavy number of concurrent virtual users performing transactions over a certain period of time. In other words, the test measures how systems handle heavy load volumes. Run Load test when you want to determine how many users your system can actually handle. Say after infrastructure sizing changes.
User reserve concurrency for the lambda functions and set the concurrency to a lower value.
Comments: Setting lower concurrency would throttle request and hence would not be advisable.
Use caching on Amazon API Gateway.
Use compute savings plan for lambda (discounted Savings Plans rates of up to 17% for a 1 or 3 year term, up to the commitment level.)
Use Amazon EC2 instead of lambda.

As a Solution Architect working for an online gaming company, you have been informed the player feedback system is slow to respond during peak periods. The feedback is reviewed weekly by the game developers. The current system submits the feedback to an Amazon API Gateway which invokes a Lambda function to first validate and then store the review in a Amazon DynamoDB table. This table has been configured with provisioned capacity.

What suggestion would you offer to remove the players wait time?

Change Amazon DynamoDB from provisioned capacity to on-demand allowing the table to scale up to handle any increases in demand.
Comments: We have no view at this time where in the architecture the slow down may be occurring.
Enable API caching and payload compression in Amazon API Gateway
Insert an Amazon Simple Queue Service queue between the API Gateway and Lambda function. Use Lambda's native SQS poller to read off the queue. Refactor the Lambda function to handle the new event object.
Increase the Lambda functions memory configuration so that it can process each client request faster.

You are creating AWS Lambda functions to handle events from an online ordering system.

What are some best practices you should follow when writing Lambda functions? (Select TWO)

Store state information within your function, but outside the function handler.
Split complex business logic into separate modular functions outside of the function handler.
Comments: This is correct as modular functions are easier to update, test, deploy and are can be loaded more efficiently.
Store database credentials directly in variables in the function.
Store complex business logic within the function handler.
Limit the use of function dependencies to only what is required.
Comments: This is correct as any additional dependencies or code can add processing time to the function, incurring additional costs and negatively affecting performance.

You are maintaining a Lambda function that has a published version 1, as well as an alias named "LIVE". All requests are configured to route to the alias. The alias currently points to version 1. You updated the function code and want to send a portion of requests to the updated function.

What is the MOST operationally efficient way to achieve this?

Add the function version $LATEST to a routing configuration on the alias.
Publish function version 2 and use API Gateway to create a routing configuration for the two versions.
Publish function version 2 and configure a routing configuration on the alias.
Comments: You can also use routing configuration on an alias to send a portion of traffic to a second function version. Both versions must be published. The alias cannot point to $LATEST.
Create a second alias and configure a routing configuration on version 1.

As a senior developer in your team, you were asked by your manager to review deployment options that may be applicable to the serverless application your team is currently working on. Since the application will be under constant heavy load, when it is pushed to production, the deployment process needs to be capable of monitoring the application during the deployment while the traffic is being shifted into the new version in 10 minute increments. Your application predominantly consists of Lambda functions, which process the business logic.


Which of the following options would be most suitable deployment option for your Lambda functions considering the above criteria?

Linear10PercentEvery10Minutes
Comments: Answer 1 is correct as the question asks to shift traffic in 10 minute increments. Linear10PercentEvery10Minutes shifts 10% of traffic every 10 minutes until 100% is shifted. Canary10Percent10Minutes Shifts 10% of traffic for first 10 minutes but then the remaining 90% is shifted straight away so this is not the most suitable option. BlueGreen10Percent10Minutes is a non existent option and AllAtOnce will shift all traffic straight away.
